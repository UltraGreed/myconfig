collection of different linux configurations which I stole over the internet and adjusted for personal usage

using nvchad as base for nvim config, therefore nvim folder has only nvchad config files

I don't want to create smart system to handle different themes, so I'm just saving their names here to not forget 

grub: polydark on pc and standby with custom bg on laptop

alacritty: carbonfox on pc and gruvbox on laptop

ranger: jungle

nvchad: catpuccin on pc and gruvbox on laptop

jetbrains: my_gruvbox with custom colorscheme
